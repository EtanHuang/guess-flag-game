# My Personal Project

## General Info

In this game, the user will be able to use their knowledge of flags to guess flags and compete with other players. Anyone with an interest in geography can play
it, but really this game is open to anyone to give a try! This game was inspired by my memorization of all __197 flags of the world__, so I decided to create a game for others to try, combining 2 of my interests, coding and geography into one role.


## User Stories
