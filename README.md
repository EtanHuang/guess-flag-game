# My Personal Project

## General Info

In this game, the user will be able to use their knowledge of flags to guess flags and compete with other players. Anyone with an interest in geography can play
it, but really this game is open to anyone to give a try! This game was inspired by my memorization of all __197 flags of the world__, so I decided to create a game for others to try, combining 2 of my interests, coding and geography into one role.


## User Stories

Phase 1: 
* As a user, I want to be able to type in my guess and receive feedback.
* As a user, I want to be able to choose between easy, normal and hard mode. 
* As a user, I want to be able to stop my current game and start a new game. 
* As a user, I want to be able to type in the number of flags I want to guess for each game.  


 Phase 2:
* As a user, I want to be able to resume from where I left off in my previous games. 
* As a user, I want to be able to have the option to save my game to file when I quit.
